# Control-Systems-2-Programming-Laboratory-Course
My implementation and solution to the Programming Laboratory Course of the course Control Systems 2 (WS 17/18) @ TUM

This is a merge of my own solution and the 'official' solution, so it may differ from the 'official' solution and also may contain some bugs and mistakes. Please help to improve these solutions and issue bugs or commit improvements.

Be also aware that the tasks are given by the [Chair of Information-Oriented Control](https://www.itr.ei.tum.de/en/home/) and are therefore their intellectual property. I do not own these!
